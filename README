Welcome to the Jungle.

What do we have planned here? Something music-centric, something akin to playdar but more collector friendly, a private music depot.

Goals as they currently stand
1. Figure out how Playdar uses tablib, start scanning files locally
2. Learn how to integrate CouchDB in to my own Erlang app
3. Pick a web framework and make something browseable
4. File downloading
5. File streaming
6. Some java client-side app for easy uploading? Something like the photo uploader from Facebook.
7. Set up peering relationships between depots for syncing arbitrarily-defined library feeds
      RIGHT?!

Where will this go? Who knows! Who cares!
